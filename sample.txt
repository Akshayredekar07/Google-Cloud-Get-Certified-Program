1. Granular Access Control: Google Cloud IAM (Identity and Access Management) allows you to define who (user) has what access (role) for which resource, providing fine-grained control over permissions.

2. Predefined Roles: GCP IAM offers predefined roles that bundle permissions to perform specific tasks, making it easier to assign appropriate access levels without having to manage individual permissions.

3. Custom Roles: In addition to predefined roles, GCP IAM allows you to create custom roles tailored to your specific needs, giving you flexibility in managing access control.

4. Audit Logging: GCP IAM integrates with Cloud Audit Logs to provide detailed logs of all access and administrative activities, helping you monitor and ensure compliance with security policies.
