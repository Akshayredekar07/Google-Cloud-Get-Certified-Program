## **Google Cloud Run - Overview**  

## **What is Cloud Run?**  
**Cloud Run** is a **fully managed compute platform** that allows you to run **containers** directly on **Google's scalable infrastructure**. It provides a **serverless** execution environment while handling scaling, networking, and operational overhead.


### **General Information**  
✅ **Launched in 2019**  
✅ Equivalent services:  
   - **AWS Fargate** (Amazon)  
   - **Azure Container Instances** (Microsoft)  
✅ **Supports any programming language** – Deploy code written in **Python, Node.js, Go, Java, etc.**  
✅ **Runs stateless containers** – No built-in persistence.  

### **Deployment & Invocation**  
✅ **Containers can be triggered by:**  
   - **Web requests** (HTTP/S endpoints)  
   - **Pub/Sub events** (Google Cloud Pub/Sub integration)  

✅ **Open API & Runtime Environment**  
   - Provides **a standard API** to manage and deploy workloads.  
   - Uses **Knative** under the hood, ensuring portability.  

✅ **Serverless & Autoscaling**  
   - **Automatically scales** based on incoming requests.  
   - Scales **down to zero** when not in use, optimizing cost.  

✅ **Flexible Pricing**  
   - **Free tier available**  
   - **Pay-per-use billing model** – Charged only for the CPU and memory used during request execution.

## **Why Use Cloud Run?**  
✔ **No need to manage infrastructure** – Google handles provisioning, scaling, and networking.  
✔ **Works with any containerized application** – Bring your own **Docker container**.  
✔ **Supports event-driven workloads** – Great for APIs, microservices, and background processing.  
✔ **Highly portable** – Can be deployed to **Cloud Run (fully managed)** or **Cloud Run for Anthos** (on Kubernetes clusters).

→ Cloud Run provides for an open API and runtime environment.

→ Cloud Run comes with a free-tier with additional Billing done on a pay per use basis.

→ It is Serverless and Runs Stateless Containers.

### **Two Ways to Run Code on Cloud Run**  

Cloud Run allows code to run in two different modes:  

1. **Cloud Run Services** run continuously and respond to web requests or events.  
2. **Cloud Run Jobs** execute a specific task and terminate once the task is completed.  

### **How Cloud Run Services Work**  
A Cloud Run Service provides the infrastructure needed to run a reliable HTTPS endpoint. Developers must ensure that their code listens on **TCP Port 1** and properly handles incoming HTTP requests.  

### **Diagram Overview**  
The diagram illustrates a process where **code, possibly written in Go, is uploaded to a storage bucket and then executed as a Cloud Run service**. A client sends a web request to an HTTPS endpoint, which routes the request to the Cloud Run Service. The service runs inside **container instances** that handle the request.  


## **Google Cloud Functions** 

- **Event-Driven Execution**:  
  - Write simple, single-purpose functions attached to events emitted from cloud infrastructure and services.  

- **Serverless Function as a Service (FaaS)**:  
  - Pay-as-you-go model with zero server management.  

- **Supported Languages**:  
  - Node.js  
  - Python 3  
  - Go  
  - Java  

- **Auto-Scaling**:  
  - Automatically scales based on load without requiring infrastructure management.  

- **Security**:  
  - Built-in security at the role and function level, following the least privilege principle.  

- **Triggering Mechanisms**:  
  - Google Cloud, Firebase, and Google Assistant  
  - Direct calls via HTTP from web, mobile, or backend applications  

- **Event Triggers**:  
  - Functions are bound to triggers to act on events. Common triggers include:  
    - Google Cloud Storage  
    - Pub/Sub  
    - HTTP  

- **Pricing Model**:  
  - Based on:  
    - Execution duration  
    - Number of invocations  
    - Provisioned resources
