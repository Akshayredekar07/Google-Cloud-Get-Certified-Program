## **VPC Network**

- A **VPC Network** is just like a physical network, except it is **virtualized within Google Cloud**.  
- It is a **global resource** that consists of a list of **regional virtual subnetworks** in data centers, all connected by a **global Wide Area Network (WAN)**.

#### **A VPC Network Provides:**
1. **Connectivity** for your **VMs**, including **GKE** & **App Engine** instances.  
2. **Native Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing**.  
3. **Connectivity to on-premises networks** using **Cloud VPN Tunnels** and **Cloud Interconnect**.  

### **VPC Characteristics:**  
- A **VPC always exists inside a project**.  
- **One project can contain multiple VPC networks**.  
- **A new project starts with a default VPC** that includes **one subnet in each region**.  


---

### **Properties of VPC Networks**  

VPC networks have the following properties:  

- **Global Scope:** VPC networks, including their associated **routes** and **firewall rules**, are **global resources**. They are **not** tied to any specific **region** or **zone**.  
- **Regional Subnets:** Subnets are **regional resources**, meaning each subnet is associated with a **specific region**. You can create **multiple subnets per region**.  
- **Unique Network Range:** Each subnet has a **unique network range** within a project.  
- **Traffic Control:** **Firewall rules** regulate both **incoming(Ingress)** and **outgoing(Egress)** traffic.  
- **Internal Communication:** Resources within a VPC can communicate with each other using **IPv4** and **IPv6** addresses.  
- **Shared VPC:** Organizations can use **Shared VPC** to maintain a **common host project** for multiple networks.  
- **VPC Peering:** VPC networks can be **connected to other VPC networks** in different projects or organizations using **VPC Network Peering**.  
- **No Broadcast or Multicast:** VPC networks **do not support broadcast or multicast addresses** within the network.  
- **Auto Mode VPC:** Auto mode VPC networks automatically create **subnets in each region**.  
- **Auto Mode Limitations:** You **cannot directly connect** two auto mode VPC networks because they use the **same IP ranges**.  

---

### **Creating an Auto Mode VPC using Console & Cloud Shell**  

#### **Step 1: Create an Auto Mode VPC Network**  
1. **Login to GCP Console → VPC Network → Create VPC Network**  
   - **Name:** `my-auto-vpc`  
   - **VPC ULA IPv6:** Disabled  
   - **Subnets:** **Automatic** (selected option)  
   - **IPv4 Firewall Rules:** Allow **TCP: 22**  
   - **Dynamic Routing Mode:** **Regional** (selected)  
   - **MTU:** 1460 / 1500 / 8896  
   - Click **Create**  

#### **Step 2: Create Virtual Machines (VMs)**  
- Navigate to **Compute Engine** → Create **two VMs** in different regions, e.g.:  
  - **VM 1:** `us-central1`  
  - **VM 2:** `asia-southeast1`  

#### **Step 3: Test Connectivity**  
- **Take SSH access** to both VMs.  
- **Ping each other** using their **private IP addresses**.  

---

### **Understanding MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit)**  
- **MTU is the size (in bytes) of the largest packet** supported by a **network layer protocol**, including both **headers and data**.  
- **Higher MTU (>1600) can be used** **only if**:  
  - The **source** and **destination interfaces** are **in the same subnet**.  
  - They communicate using **private IP addresses**.  

---

### **Network Diagram Representation**  

**GCP Project:** `VPC-Project`  
**VPC Network:** `my-auto-vpc`  

```
[VM with IP 10.148.0.2]  --- Ping --->  [VM with IP 10.128.0.2]  
   Subnet: 10.148.0.0/20                      Subnet: 10.128.0.0/20  
   Region: asia-southeast1                    Region: us-central1  

Firewall Rule: ICMP-allow  
```

---

## **Creating a Custom VPC in GCP: Cloud Shell vs. Console**  


#### **1. Create a VPC**  
```bash
gcloud compute networks create vpc-name --project=project-id --subnet-mode=custom 
```
- `vpc-name`: Desired VPC name  
- `project-id`: Your GCP project ID  
- `--subnet-mode=custom`: Enables manual subnet creation  

#### **2. Create a Subnet**  
```bash
gcloud compute networks subnets create subnet-name --network=vpc-name --region=region-name --range=10.0.3.0/24
```
- `subnet-name`: Desired subnet name  
- `vpc-name`: Associated VPC  
- `region-name`: GCP region (e.g., `us-central1`)  
- `--range`: CIDR block for subnet  

#### **3. Verify Available Networks**  
```bash
gcloud compute networks list
```

#### **4. Create a Firewall Rule**  
```bash
gcloud compute firewall-rules create fwrule-allow-icmp-ssh-rdp \
--direction=INGRESS --priority=1000 --network=vpc-name --action=ALLOW \
--rules=icmp,tcp:22,tcp:3389 --source-ranges=0.0.0.0/0
```
- Allows ICMP (ping), SSH (port 22), and RDP (port 3389) from any source  
- **Security Note:** Restrict `--source-ranges` in production environments  

---

### **GCP Console Steps**  

#### **1. Log in & Select Project**  
- Open **GCP Console**  
- Select your **GCP project**  

#### **2. Create VPC Network**  
- **Name:** `mycustom-vpc`  
- **Subnet mode:** `Custom`  
- **Add Subnets:**  
  - **Subnet-asia-east1** → `10.0.1.0/24`  
  - **Subnet-us-east1** → `10.0.2.0/24`  

#### **3. Configure Firewall Rules**  
- Enable **ICMP** and **SSH**  

#### **4. Select Dynamic Routing Mode**  
- Choose **Regional**  

#### **5. Click "Create"**

## **Google Cloud VPC Network Peering**  

### **Overview**  
- **VPC Network Peering** enables **internal IP connectivity** between **two VPC networks**, even if they belong to **different projects or organizations**.  
- Peered traffic remains **within Google’s private network** and does **not** traverse the **public internet**.  

---

## **VPC Peering**  

- **Supports Compute Engine, GKE, and App Engine (Flexible Environment).**  
- **Independent Peering Setup:**  
   - Each side of a **peering association** is configured separately.  
   - Peering is **active only when both sides have matching configurations**.  
- **Flexible Peering Management:**  
   - Either side can **delete** the peering association at any time.  
- **Supports IPv4 Connectivity Only.**  
- **CIDR Overlap Not Allowed:**  
   - The **IP ranges of peered networks must be unique** (no overlap).  
- **No Transitive Peering:**  
   - A **VPC cannot use a peered network to reach another peered VPC**.  
- **Peering Limits:**  
   - **A single VPC can be directly peered with up to 25 other VPCs**.  
- **Compatible with Shared VPCs.**  


---

### **What is NAT?**  
- **Network Address Translation (NAT)** is a technique for **remapping IP addresses** by modifying the **IP header** of network packets.  
- This is typically performed by a **NAT device** (e.g., router, firewall, or cloud NAT gateway).  

### **What is IP Masquerading (NAT)?**  
- **IP Masquerading (NAT)** hides multiple **private IP addresses** behind a **single public IP**.  
- Outgoing traffic appears to come **from the public IP** rather than individual private IPs.  
- This helps **conserve IPv4 addresses** and **improves security** by **hiding internal IPs**.  

---

## **Cloud NAT in Google Cloud**  

### **What is Cloud NAT?**  
- **Cloud NAT (Network Address Translation)** allows **outbound** traffic from **Google Cloud resources** to the **internet** **without assigning public IP addresses**.  
- It provides **controlled internet access** while maintaining **security and scalability**.  

### **Key Features of Cloud NAT:**  
 - **Allows outbound internet access** for private instances **without public IPs**.  
 - **Blocks inbound traffic** from the internet (enhanced security).  
 - **Supports multiple Cloud NAT Gateways per region**, but **each is configured for a different subnet**.  

**VMs in different subnets use different Cloud NAT Gateways for internet access.**  

---

## **Key Considerations for Cloud NAT**
**Enables outbound internet access** for private resources **without exposing them** to the public.  
**Enhances security** by preventing direct inbound connections from the internet.  
**Useful for scenarios like software updates, API calls, or external integrations.**  

---

### **What Does Cloud NAT Provide Outgoing Connectivity For?**  

Cloud NAT **enables outbound internet connectivity** for the following **private resources** in Google Cloud:  

- **Compute Engine VM instances** without external IP addresses.  
- **Private GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine) clusters**.  
- **Cloud Run instances** via **Serverless VPC Access**.  
- **Cloud Functions** via **Serverless VPC Access**.  
- **App Engine Standard Environment instances** via **Serverless VPC Access**.  

---

## **Limitations**  

**Cloud NAT cannot apply to custom routes** whose **next hop is not the default internet gateway**.  

**Google Cloud NAT is built on Andromeda**, Google’s **network virtualization stack**.  

**No intermediate NAT proxies** in the data path—  
   - Each VM is **directly programmed by Google Cloud** to perform **NAT using assigned ports**.  

**Each Cloud NAT Gateway is associated with:**  
   - **One VPC network**  
   - **One region**  
   - **One Cloud Router**  
   - Cannot be shared across multiple regions.  

**Cloud NAT is not used for internal VPC communication**—  
   - It is **only designed for outbound connectivity to the internet**.  

---

Cloud NAT pricing is based on the following usage factors:  

### **Hourly Cost of NAT Gateway**
   - **Depends on the number of VM instances** using the NAT Gateway.  

### **Per-GB Cost for Data Processed**
   - **Charges apply for outbound (egress) data processed by the gateway.**  
   - **No charges for inbound traffic.** *(Correction: "ingress" was crossed out and replaced with "inbound" in the original image.)*  

---

## **Cloud NAT Pricing**  

| **Number of Assigned VMs** | **Price per Hour** | **Price per GB Processed (Outbound Data)** |
|----------------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Up to 32 VMs**           | `$0.014 × No. of VMs × Hours` | `$0.045` |
| **Above 32 VMs**           | `$0.44` (flat rate) | `$0.045` |

---

 
✅ **Pay-as-you-go model** based on the number of VMs.  
✅ **Flat rate applies once the VM count exceeds 32**.  
✅ **Only outbound (egress) traffic is billed at $0.045 per GB**.  
✅ **Inbound (ingress) traffic is not charged**.

– Explanation:** Assigning a static external IP ensures that an instance retains its public address after stopping and starting again.


Below are 20 scenario‐based multiple‐choice questions focused on VPC networks – each question is followed by four options, the correct answer, and a brief explanation.

---
**Question 1**  
Your company has a custom VPC network in us‑central1 with a subnet 10.0.0.0/24. You plan to launch new Compute Engine instances in us‑east1 that must communicate with existing instances over private IPs without exposing traffic to the public internet. What should you do?  

A. Create a new VPC network in us‑east1 and connect the two networks via Cloud VPN.  
B. Create a new subnet in us‑east1 in the same VPC network.  
C. Use VPC Network Peering between two separate networks.  
D. Migrate the instances to an auto‑mode VPC network.  

**Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** In a custom mode VPC, you can extend your network by creating additional subnets in different regions. Instances in different regions within the same VPC communicate using internal IPs without needing public exposure.

---

**Question 2**  
Two teams in different projects (Project A and Project B) need their Compute Engine instances to communicate privately. Both projects have their own custom VPC networks. What is the recommended solution?  

A. Establish VPC network peering between the two VPCs.  
B. Set up a Cloud VPN tunnel between the projects.  
C. Create a Shared VPC by moving one project under the other.  
D. Use Cloud Interconnect to link the networks.  

**Correct Answer:** A  
**Explanation:** VPC network peering enables private connectivity between separate VPC networks (even across projects) without using external gateways or VPNs.

---

**Question 3**  
Your organization uses a Shared VPC for centralized network management. A new department creates its own project and needs to deploy resources using the centralized VPC. What is the appropriate action?  

A. Create a new VPC network in the new project.  
B. Attach the new project as a service project to the Shared VPC host project.  
C. Configure VPC peering between the new project and the host project.  
D. Set up a Cloud VPN between the projects.  

**Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** In a Shared VPC architecture, service projects are attached to a host project that holds the network resources. This allows resources in the service project to use subnets and policies defined in the host project.

---

**Question 4**  
A security administrator needs to allow SSH access to specific Compute Engine instances only from the corporate office IP range (203.0.113.0/24). Which VPC feature should be configured?  

A. VPC Network Peering.  
B. Firewall rules.  
C. Cloud NAT.  
D. Private Google Access.  

**Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** Firewall rules in a VPC allow you to specify source IP ranges and protocols. By creating an ingress rule that permits SSH (TCP port 22) from 203.0.113.0/24, you restrict access appropriately.

---

**Question 5**  
Your Compute Engine instances need outbound internet access but must not be reachable from the public internet. What is the best practice?  

A. Assign each instance an external IP address.  
B. Disable external IP addresses and use Cloud NAT for outbound traffic.  
C. Use a VPN gateway to route all traffic.  
D. Create firewall rules that block all inbound traffic.  

**Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** By not assigning external IPs, instances are not directly reachable. Cloud NAT provides them with outbound internet connectivity while keeping them private.

---

**Question 6**  
An instance without an external IP address must access Google Cloud APIs and services. Which configuration should you enable?  

A. VPC network peering.  
B. Private Google Access.  
C. Cloud VPN.  
D. Cloud Router.  

**Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** Private Google Access allows instances that lack external IP addresses to reach Google APIs and services using internal IPs.

---

**Question 7**  
Your on‑premises data center must connect securely to your VPC network over the public internet. Which service should you use?  

A. VPC Network Peering.  
B. Cloud VPN.  
C. Shared VPC.  
D. Cloud Interconnect.  

**Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** Cloud VPN creates an IPSec tunnel over the public internet, securely connecting your on‑premises network with your VPC.

---

**Question 8**  
Your on‑premises network is connected to your VPC via Cloud VPN. To automatically learn and update routes between your on‑premises network and the VPC, which service must you add?  

A. VPC Network Peering.  
B. Cloud Router.  
C. Cloud NAT.  
D. Private Google Access.  

**Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** Cloud Router works with Cloud VPN to exchange routes dynamically using BGP, ensuring that any routing changes are automatically updated.

---

**Question 9**  
To protect sensitive data from exfiltration, your security team wants to place a security perimeter around your Cloud Storage and managed services. Which feature addresses this concern?  

A. VPC Network Peering.  
B. VPC Service Controls.  
C. Shared VPC.  
D. Firewall rules.  

**Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** VPC Service Controls allow you to define security perimeters around Google Cloud resources to help prevent data exfiltration, adding an extra layer of protection.

---

**Question 10**  
You need to allow a partner’s specific applications to access only selected services in your VPC network. How do you ensure that only traffic on approved ports is permitted?  

A. Use VPC network peering and then apply firewall rules.  
B. Deploy a Shared VPC.  
C. Set up a Cloud VPN tunnel with strict ACLs.  
D. Use Cloud Interconnect with dedicated capacity.  

**Correct Answer:** A  
**Explanation:** VPC peering enables private connectivity while firewall rules can restrict traffic to specific ports and protocols, providing granular control over which traffic is allowed.

---

**Question 11**  
Your multi‑region application requires precise control over IP ranges in each region. Your current auto‑mode VPC network creates subnets automatically. What should you do?  

A. Switch to a custom mode VPC network and create subnets manually.  
B. Use VPC network peering to override subnet ranges.  
C. Enable Cloud NAT to modify IP ranges.  
D. Create firewall rules to adjust IP ranges.  

**Correct Answer:** A  
**Explanation:** A custom mode VPC network gives you full control over subnet creation and IP ranges in each region, unlike auto‑mode where ranges are automatically assigned.

---

**Question 12**  
Instances in your VPC located in different regions cannot communicate via internal IPs. What is the most likely reason?  

A. The VPC network is in auto mode.  
B. There is no subnet in one of the regions.  
C. The instances lack external IP addresses.  
D. Firewall rules are blocking internal traffic.  

**Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** For instances to use internal IP communication across regions, a subnet must exist in each region. If one region lacks a subnet, instances cannot be deployed there or communicate properly.

---

**Question 13**  
Your security team requires that all traffic between Compute Engine instances is inspected by a virtual appliance. How can you route traffic through the appliance?  

A. Use VPC Network Peering with a custom filter.  
B. Create custom static routes that set the virtual appliance as the next hop.  
C. Enable Cloud NAT on the instances.  
D. Use Private Google Access.  

**Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** By creating custom static routes with the virtual appliance as the next hop, you can force traffic between instances to flow through the appliance for inspection.

---

**Question 14**  
You need to restrict access to a specific Compute Engine instance so that only one other known instance (using a specific internal IP or network tag) can connect to it. Which action should you take?  

A. Allow ingress from the entire VPC CIDR.  
B. Create a firewall rule permitting ingress only from the specific source IP or tag.  
C. Deny all ingress and rely on default routing.  
D. Configure VPC peering with only that instance’s project.  

**Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** A firewall rule that permits ingress only from the known source (by IP address or network tag) restricts access to the instance as required.

---

**Question 15**  
Your organization has several standalone VPC networks that you’d like to interconnect without migrating resources into a single Shared VPC. What is the most straightforward method?  

A. Migrate all resources to a single VPC network.  
B. Use VPC network peering between the standalone networks.  
C. Set up Cloud VPN tunnels between each pair of VPC networks.  
D. Use Cloud Interconnect to consolidate connectivity.  

**Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** VPC network peering provides a straightforward way to interconnect multiple VPC networks so that resources can communicate privately without migrating them into one network.

---

**Question 16**  
A legacy application relies on broadcast and multicast traffic, which is not supported by standard VPC networks. How can you address this limitation?  

A. Modify the application to use unicast messaging or use an overlay network that simulates broadcast/multicast.  
B. Change the VPC network from custom to auto mode.  
C. Implement VPC network peering to enable multicast.  
D. Use Cloud VPN to simulate broadcast traffic.  

**Correct Answer:** A  
**Explanation:** Since GCP VPC networks do not support broadcast/multicast, the recommended solution is to modify the application or use a software‑defined overlay network that simulates the required behavior.

---

**Question 17**  
To meet compliance requirements, auditors need to review all changes made to your VPC network’s firewall rules over the past year. Which service should you use?  

A. Cloud Monitoring.  
B. Cloud Trace.  
C. Cloud Audit Logs.  
D. Stackdriver Debugger.  

**Correct Answer:** C  
**Explanation:** Cloud Audit Logs capture administrative actions (including firewall rule changes) across your GCP resources, making them the appropriate tool for auditing changes.

---

**Question 18**  
Your application uses a managed service (Cloud SQL) that should be accessed privately from your VPC network without exposing traffic to the internet. Which setup is necessary?  

A. Enable Cloud NAT for the VPC.  
B. Configure Private Services Access by allocating a dedicated subnet.  
C. Use VPC network peering between the VPC and Cloud SQL.  
D. Assign external IP addresses to Cloud SQL.  

**Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** Private Services Access allows your VPC to connect to Google-managed services (like Cloud SQL) using private IP addresses. This requires setting up a dedicated subnet (private connection) for that purpose.

---

**Question 19**  
After configuring several firewall rules, you suspect one rule is unintentionally denying traffic between two instance groups. What is the best method to diagnose the issue?  

A. Recreate the VPC network.  
B. Use VPC Flow Logs to analyze allowed and denied connections.  
C. Enable Private Google Access on the instances.  
D. Switch the VPC mode from custom to auto.  

**Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** VPC Flow Logs provide detailed information about the traffic flowing through your network and whether it was allowed or denied by firewall rules. This helps you pinpoint misconfigurations.

---

**Question 20**  
A partner organization must access your internal web application hosted on Compute Engine, but you do not want to grant them direct VPC access. What is the best approach?  

A. Create a Cloud VPN tunnel with the partner’s network.  
B. Use VPC Network Peering with restrictive firewall rules.  
C. Protect the application using Identity‑Aware Proxy (IAP).  
D. Assign a public IP address and use HTTPS with basic auth.  

**Correct Answer:** C  
**Explanation:** Identity‑Aware Proxy (IAP) allows you to control access to your web applications without exposing your entire VPC network. It provides secure, granular access based on identity.

Below is a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) cheat sheet for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) along with several command-based questions you can use to test your practical knowledge. The cheat sheet summarizes key concepts, best practices, and common commands to create and manage VPC networks, subnets, and firewall rules using the gcloud CLI.

---

## Google Cloud VPC Cheat Sheet

### Key Concepts
- **VPC Network:**  
  - A global, logically isolated network in GCP.
  - Contains regional subnets that define IP ranges.
  - Supports internal communication using private IPs.

- **Subnets:**  
  - Regional resources.
  - Manually created in custom mode or auto-created in auto mode.
  - Specify a CIDR range (e.g., 10.0.0.0/24).

- **CIDR Notation:**  
  - `/28` means 16 IP addresses (14 usable).
  - `/24` means 256 IP addresses.
  - Ensure subnets do not overlap.

- **Firewall Rules:**  
  - Define ingress and egress traffic controls.
  - Rules are stateful and use priorities (0 is highest; 65535 is lowest).
  - Example defaults: allow internal traffic, allow SSH (tcp:22), allow RDP (tcp:3389), allow ICMP.

- **VPC Peering:**  
  - Connects different VPC networks (within or across projects) for private communication.
  - Not transitive (each peering is one-to-one).

- **Shared VPC:**  
  - Allows multiple projects (service projects) to share a host project’s VPC.
  - Helps centralize network management.

- **Private Google Access:**  
  - Enables instances without external IPs to reach Google APIs and services.

- **Cloud NAT:**  
  - Provides outbound internet access for instances without external IP addresses.

Below are five advanced, command‐based questions on Google Cloud VPC networking. Each question includes a scenario, answer options, the correct answer, and a brief explanation.

---

### Advanced Question 1: Shared VPC Association

**Scenario:**  
Your organization uses a Shared VPC architecture. You have a host project (ID: `host-proj`) with a custom VPC and need to allow a service project (ID: `service-proj`) to use this network. Which command correctly associates the service project with the host project’s Shared VPC?

A.  
```bash
gcloud compute shared-vpc associated-projects link service-proj --host-project=host-proj
```

B.  
```bash
gcloud compute shared-vpc associated-projects add service-proj --host-project=host-proj
```

C.  
```bash
gcloud compute shared-vpc attach service-proj --host-project=host-proj
```

D.  
```bash
gcloud compute shared-vpc add-association service-proj --host-project=host-proj
```

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**  
The proper command to associate a service project with a host project’s Shared VPC is using the **`associated-projects add`** subcommand. Option B is the correct syntax.

---

### Advanced Question 2: VPC Peering Between Projects

**Scenario:**  
You need to peer two VPC networks located in separate projects. In project **proj‑a**, the VPC is named **vpc-a**; in project **proj‑b**, the VPC is **vpc-b**. Which of the following sequences is required to establish peering between these networks?

A.  
1. In proj‑a:  
   ```bash
   gcloud compute networks peerings create vpc-a-to-vpc-b \
     --network=vpc-a \
     --peer-project=proj-b \
     --peer-network=vpc-b
   ```
2. In proj‑b:  
   ```bash
   gcloud compute networks peerings create vpc-b-to-vpc-a \
     --network=vpc-b \
     --peer-project=proj-a \
     --peer-network=vpc-a
   ```

B. Use a single command from either project to create peering.  
C. Use Cloud VPN tunnels instead of peering.  
D. First, merge both VPCs into a Shared VPC, then access them.

**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanation:**  
VPC peering must be established from both sides. Option A shows the two‑step process: each project initiates a peering request toward the other VPC. A single command (Option B) is insufficient.

---

### Advanced Question 3: Cloud NAT Configuration

**Scenario:**  
Your Compute Engine instances reside in a private subnet called **priv-sub** within the VPC **prod-vpc** in the `us-central1` region. These instances lack external IP addresses yet require outbound internet access. Which sequence of commands correctly sets up Cloud NAT?

A.  
1. Create a Cloud Router:  
   ```bash
   gcloud compute routers create nat-router --network=prod-vpc --region=us-central1
   ```  
2. Create the NAT configuration:  
   ```bash
   gcloud compute routers nat create prod-nat \
     --router=nat-router --region=us-central1 \
     --nat-all-subnet-ip-ranges --auto-allocate-nat-external-ips
   ```

B.  
```bash
gcloud compute nat create prod-nat --network=prod-vpc --region=us-central1 --external-ip-auto
```

C.  
```bash
gcloud compute routers create nat-router --network=prod-vpc --region=us-central1 --enable-nat
```

D.  
```bash
gcloud compute routers nat update prod-nat --region=us-central1 --auto
```

**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanation:**  
Option A outlines the proper two‑step process: first, create a Cloud Router; then configure Cloud NAT on that router using the `nat create` subcommand with flags to include all subnet IP ranges and auto‑allocate external IPs.

---

### Advanced Question 4: Custom Static Route Creation

**Scenario:**  
You must direct traffic destined for the IP range **192.168.100.0/24** from your VPC **prod-vpc** through a specific next-hop instance with internal IP **10.0.0.5**. Which command creates this custom static route?

A.  
```bash
gcloud compute routes create route-to-192-168-100 \
  --network=prod-vpc \
  --destination-range=192.168.100.0/24 \
  --next-hop-address=10.0.0.5 \
  --priority=1000
```

B.  
```bash
gcloud compute routes create route-192-168-100 \
  --network=prod-vpc \
  --dest-range=192.168.100.0/24 \
  --next-hop=10.0.0.5
```

C.  
```bash
gcloud compute routes add route-to-192-168-100 \
  --network=prod-vpc \
  --destination=192.168.100.0/24 \
  --next-hop-address=10.0.0.5
```

D.  
```bash
gcloud compute networks routes create route-to-192-168-100 \
  --network=prod-vpc \
  --range=192.168.100.0/24 \
  --nexthop=10.0.0.5
```

**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanation:**  
Option A uses the correct subcommand and flag names. It creates a route in the VPC with the specified destination range and next-hop address, while setting an appropriate priority.

---

### Advanced Question 5: Inventory of Internal IPs via Cloud Asset Inventory

**Scenario:**  
You need to generate an inventory of all internal IP addresses assigned to Compute Engine instances in your VPC **prod-vpc**. Which gcloud command (or combination) is most effective?

A.  
```bash
gcloud asset search-all-resources \
  --scope="projects/PROJECT_ID" \
  --asset-types="compute.googleapis.com/Instance" \
  --query="networkInterfaces.network:prod-vpc" \
  --format="table(name, networkInterfaces.network, networkInterfaces.networkIP)"
```

B.  
```bash
gcloud compute instances list --filter="networkInterfaces.network:prod-vpc" --format="table(name, zone, networkInterfaces.networkIP)"
```

C. Use both commands A and B to cover all resources.
D. Neither A nor B provides complete information.

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**  
No single command lists every internal IP because some resources (like GKE autopilot clusters) may not show in a simple instance list. Combining Cloud Asset Inventory (Option A) with the Compute Engine instances list (Option B) provides a more comprehensive inventory across the project.

---

These advanced questions cover Shared VPC, VPC peering, Cloud NAT, custom static routes, and asset inventory—all key for deeper GCP networking administration using the gcloud CLI.

Happy learning and networking on Google Cloud!
