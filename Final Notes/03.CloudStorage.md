### Cloud Storage  

- **Cloud Storage** is a service provided by Google Cloud for storing your data.  
- An **object** is a piece of data, which can be any type of file and of any size.  

- You store objects in **containers** called **buckets**.  

### Ways to Access or Interact with Cloud Storage  
1. **Console**: Use the Google Cloud Console for a graphical user interface.  
2. **gsutil**: A command-line tool to manage Cloud Storage.  
3. **Client Libraries**: Libraries available for different programming languages to interact with Cloud Storage.  
4. **REST APIs**: Use HTTP requests to manage and access the storage programmatically.  

---  

## Cloud Storage Classes  

- Cloud storage is categorized into different classes based on access frequency and storage duration.  
### Storage Classes  

1. **Standard Storage**  
   - **Access**: Instant access to data.  
   - **Cost**: Higher cost per GB, best for frequently accessed data.  
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for active data availability.  

2. **Nearline Storage**  
   - **Access**: Data that is accessed less than once a month.  
   - **Cost**: Lower cost than Standard Storage, good balance for occasional access.  
   - **Use Case**: Suitable for data that needs to be retained but is not accessed frequently.  

3. **Coldline Storage**  
   - **Access**: Data that is rarely accessed, typically less than once a year.  
   - **Cost**: Significantly lower cost per GB compared to Standard and Nearline.  
   - **Use Case**: Best for long-term storage needs where data retrieval is infrequent.  

4. **Archive Storage**  
   - **Access**: Data that is seldom accessed and kept for long-term archival.  
   - **Cost**: Lowest cost for storage, but retrieval time may be longer.  
   - **Use Case**: Effective for compliance and historical data that must be retained.  

---  

### Additional Considerations  
- **Cost Management**:  
  - As storage class changes from Standard to Archive, the **GB cost decreases**.  
  - However, **data retrieval times increase**, making immediate access more challenging for lower-tier storage.  

- **Data Retention Example**:  
  - A shop's sales data might be stored for **1 year**.  
  - Key dates in this context:  
    - Sales data recorded from **18 Feb 2022** to **15 Aug 2022**.  
    - Data retention period extends to **31 Dec 2023** to ensure compliance and historical record-keeping.

## Storage Classes  

### Overview of Storage Classes  
- **Storage classes** are a piece of metadata used by every object in Google Cloud Storage.  
  
### Types of Storage Classes  
1. **Standard Storage**  
   - Designed for frequently accessed data.  

2. **Nearline Storage**  
   - For data that is accessed less than once a month.  

3. **Coldline Storage**  
   - For data that is rarely accessed, typically less than once a year.  

4. **Archive Storage**  
   - Best for long-term storage of data that is rarely accessed.  
   - **Cost**: Generally cheaper compared to other storage classes.  

### Important Points  
- The **storage class** set for an object affects:  
  - **Object availability**: How quickly you can access the data.  
  - **Pricing model**: The costs associated with storing and retrieving data.  

- **Changing Storage Classes**:  
  - You can change the storage class of an existing object by:  
    - **Rewriting the object**: Create a new object with the desired storage class.  
    - **Using Object Lifecycle Management**: Automatically manage the transition of objects between storage classes based on predefined rules.


### Notes on Bucket Creation in Google Cloud Storage  

- **Creating a Bucket**:  
  - When you create a bucket in Google Cloud Storage, you have the option to specify a **default storage class** for that bucket.  
  
- **Default Behavior**:  
  - If you do not specify a storage class during bucket creation, the default storage class will be set to **Standard**.  
  
### Key Points  
- **Default Storage Class**: This affects how data is stored and the cost associated with storage.  
- **Understanding Storage Classes**: Familiarize yourself with various storage classes (like Nearline, Coldline, and Archive) to optimize costs based on data access patterns.


### Benefits of All Storage Classes  

All storage classes provide the following benefits:  

- **Unlimited Storage**:   
  - No minimum object size required.  
  
- **Worldwide Accessibility**:   
  - Accessible from anywhere with worldwide storage locations.  

- **Low Latency**:   
  - Quick access to stored data.  

- **High Durability**:   
  - Offers durability of **99.999999999%**.  

- **Geo Redundancy**:   
  - Data can be stored in multi-region or dual-region setups for added reliability.


### Cloud Storage Guidelines  

- **Uniform Experience**:   
  - Provides a consistent experience with Cloud Storage features, security, tools, and APIs.  

- **Data Redundancy**:   
  - Objects written to Cloud Storage must be redundantly stored in at least two different availability zones before the write is acknowledged as successful.  

- **Maximum Object Size**:   
  - The maximum size of an object stored in a Cloud Bucket is **5 TiB**.  

- **Access Control List (ACL) Limit**:   
  - There is a limit of **100 ACL entries** per object.  

- **Multipart Upload**:  
  - A multipart upload can have up to **10,000 parts**.  
  - Each individual part has a maximum size limit of **5 GiB**.  
  - Objects assembled from a multipart upload are subject to the overall **5 TiB size limit**.



## Storage Classes  
- **Standard Storage**:   
  - Costliest option.  
  - Best for frequently accessed data (Hot Data) or data stored for brief periods.  

- **Nearline Storage**:   
  - For data accessed less than once a month.  

- **Coldline Storage**:   
  - For data accessed less than once a year.  

- **Archive Storage**:   
  - Cheapest option for long-term storage of infrequently accessed data.  

---  

## Standard Storage Details  
- **Usage Context**:  
  - Appropriate for data that is frequently accessed.  
  - When used in a region, it's ideal for storing data close to GKE Clusters or Compute Engine instances.  

---  

## Regional and Multi-Regional Storage  
- **Regional Storage**:  
  - Redundant within a specific region.  

- **Dual-Region Storage**:  
  - Improved availability.  

- **Multi-Regional Storage**:  
  - Ideal for data accessed globally, such as for:  
    - Serving website content.  
    - Streaming videos.  
    - Executing interactive workloads and gaming data.  

- **Geo-Redundancy**:  
  - Multi-regional storage is stored across two or more regions, typically 500 miles apart.  

---  

### Availability of Standard Storage  
- **Location Type**:   
  - Multi-Region: **99.95% SLA**  
  - Dual-Region: **99.95% SLA**  
  - Regional: **99.90% SLA**


### NEARLINE STORAGE

Nearline storage is a low-cost, highly durable storage service for storing infrequently accessed data.

→ Nearline storage is a better choice than Standard storage in scenarios where slightly lower availability, a 30-day minimum storage duration, and cost for data access are acceptable trade-offs for lowered at-rest storage costs.

→ Nearline storage is ideal for data you plan to read or modify on average once per month.


## Nearline and Coldline Storage Availability

### Nearline Storage Availability

| Location Type | Availability SLA |
|---|---|
| Multi-region | 99.9% |
| Dual-region | 99.9% |
| Region | 99.0% |

### Coldline Storage

→ Coldline storage provides a very low-cost, highly durable storage service for storing infrequently accessed data (cold data).

→ Coldline Storage is ideal for data you plan to read or modify at most once a quarter.

→ Availability is the same as Nearline.

### Archive Storage  

Archive storage is the cheapest, highly durable storage service for data archiving, online backup, and disaster recovery.  

- **Availability**: Unlike the ‘coldest’ storage service offered by other cloud providers, your data is available within milliseconds, not hours or days.  
  
- **Cost**: Archive storage has a higher cost for data access, as well as a 365-day minimum storage duration.  

- **Best Choice**: Archive storage is the best choice for data that you plan to access less than once a year.  

### Availability is the Same as Nearline or Coldline  

### To Maximize the Availability of Your Data:  

- Consider storing your data in a multi-region or dual-region bucket location if high availability is a top requirement.  

- All data is stored geo-redundantly in these locations, which means your data is stored in at least two geographically separated regions. In the unlikely event of a region-wide outage, buckets in geo-redundant locations remain available, with no need to change the storage path.  

- You cannot change the bucket location or project after creation.

## Cloud Storage pricing is based on the following components:

1.  Data Storage
2.  Data Processing
3.  Network Usage

**Data Storage:** The amount of data stored in your buckets. Storage rates vary depending on the storage class of your data and the location of your buckets.

**Data Processing:** The processing done by Cloud Storage, which includes operation charges, any applicable retrieval fees, and inter-region replication.

**Network Usage:** The amount of data read from or moved between your buckets.

**Example: Data Storage Cost in Iowa**

|                      | Standard | Nearline | Coldline | Archive  |
|----------------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Regional             | $0.020   | $0.010   | $0.004   | $0.0012  |
| Dual-Region          | $0.022   | $0.011   | $0.0044  | $0.0014  |
| Multi-region         | $0.026   | $0.010   | $0.007   | $0.004   |

**Note:** Dual regions are billed to both underlying regions at the above prices.

**Example:** Standard Storage in a dual-region comprised of Iowa and Oregon will be billed at $0.22 per GB per month for Iowa and $0.22 per GB per month for Oregon.


## **Data Processing Fees:** 
Data processing costs consist of operation charges (which apply to all requests made to Cloud Storage), retrieval fees (which apply to reading data stored in certain storage classes), and inter-region replication charges (which apply to data written to dual regions and multi-regions).

The price is $0.05 per 10,000 operations in Standard Storage, and $0.10 per 10,000 operations in Nearline and Coldline.

**Retrieval/Network Usage Fees:** Applies when you read, copy, move, or rewrite object data or metadata that is stored using Nearline storage, Coldline storage, or Archive Storage.

|          | Standard | Nearline | Coldline | Archive  |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
|          | $0/GB    | $0.01/GB | $0.02/GB | $0.05/GB |

→ Default inter-region replication is free. Turbo replication is $0.04/GB chargeable.

→ Data moves within the same location are free.

→ Data moves between different locations on the same continent are chargeable.

→ Data moves between different continents are chargeable.

## Cloud Storage: Buckets & Objects

### Bucket

*   A bucket is like a folder for your objects.
*   Using buckets, you can organize and maintain access permissions.
*   You cannot create nested buckets.
*   A bucket has a name, default storage class, and geographic location.
*   The name and location can only be changed by deleting and recreating the bucket.
*   There is only one Google Cloud Storage namespace, which means every bucket must have a unique name across the entire Google Cloud Storage namespace.

### Object

*   An object is a file that you want to store.
*   Objects can be up to 5 TiB in size.
*   An object has data and metadata.
*   There is no limit on the number of objects in a bucket.
*   Objects are immutable, but you can overwrite objects.
*   Object names must be unique only within a given bucket.

### Turbo Replication

Turbo replication is a Cloud Storage premium feature designed to asynchronously replicate newly written Cloud Storage objects (associated with any insert, rewrite, copy, or compose operation—regardless of object size) to a separate region within a target of 15 minutes.
