   - Top level; manages **billing accounts**, **permissions**, and **policies** (highest priority).  
2. **Folders**:  
   - Group multiple projects; help apply policies at scale.  
3. **Projects**:  
   - Core entity for managing **resources**; linked to **one billing account**.  
   - Example: *My First Project*.  
4. **Resources**:  
   - Belong to **one project only**.  
   - Examples: **VM instances**, **Cloud Storage**, **Databases**, **APIs**.  

---

**Billing Structure:**  
- **Bottom-to-top** aggregation (resources → project → folder → organization).  
- Example costs: ₹100, ₹1000, ₹2000.  

---

**Key Concepts:**  
- Resembles a **file system hierarchy**:  
  - Example: `/organization/folder/project/resource`  
  - Similar to OS structure: `/home/user/documents/...`  
- **Access & policies** automatically inherited down the hierarchy unless overridden.  

---

**Additional Points:**  
- Each **resource** has **one parent**.  
- **High availability** ensured through **live migration** and **multi-region deployment**.
