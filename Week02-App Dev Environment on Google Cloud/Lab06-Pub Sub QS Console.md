## Pub/Sub: Qwik Start - Console

**Overview**  
Pub/Sub is a messaging service for exchanging event data among applications and services. A producer of data publishes messages to a Pub/Sub topic. A consumer creates a subscription to that topic. Subscribers either pull messages from a subscription or are configured as webhooks for push subscriptions. Every subscriber must acknowledge each message within a configurable window of time.

### What You'll Learn:
- Set up a topic to hold data.
- Subscribe to a topic to access the data.
- Publish and then consume messages with a pull subscriber.
